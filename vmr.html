        Vangaveeti Mohana Ranga Rao (4 July 1947 – 26 December 1988) was an Indian politician from Andhra Pradesh.[1] He
        represented Vijayawada East assembly constituency as a member of Indian National Congress.

        Ranga's elder brother, Vangaveeti Radha Krishna Rao Sr., was associated with Chalasani Venkata Rathnam,
        secretary of the Communist Party of India, Vijayawada. However, conflicts arose between Venkata Rathnam and
        Vangaveeti Radha, to get a hold on Vijayawada transport business, dominated by Datti Kanaka Rao, a follower of
        Chalasani Venkata Rathnam. In 1972, both Kanaka Rao, and Venkata Rathnam were allegedly murdered by Vangaveeti
        Radha's supporters. These events in turn led to a retaliation by a rival group, ending in the murder of
        Vangaveeti Radha. Upon the death of Vangaveeti Radha, his brother Mohana Ranga took over the leadership of
        United independent Organization with the support of student union leaders Devineni Chandrasekhar (Gandhi), and
        Devineni Rajasekhar (Nehru).[2]

        Vangaveeti Ranga entered public life after the death of his elder brother Vangaveeti Radha Krishna Sr. His
        political career began in 1981, when he ran in the municipal election and the Congress Party withdrew its
        candidate in his favor. His rival in the district, Devineni Rajasekhar, (Nehru), was sponsored by the Telugu
        Desam Party (TDP).[3] Ranga became an MLA for the Congress Party in 1985; Rajasekhar became a TDP MLA, and
        eventually a minister.[1] Starting in 1983 both parties were implicated in gang warfare; N. T. Rama Rao was at
        the time the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.[3] The gang warfare in Vijayawada dated further back; Ranga had
        served time in prison for the murder of Rajasekhar's brother Gandhi.[1] On 10 March 1988, Rajasekhar's one more
        brother Murali was killed, and followers of Ranga were accused. Ranga also campaigned against police abuse. On
        10 July 1988, a rally called Kapunadu proclaimed him leader of the Kapus; he was in prison at the time, but
        after his release later that month began a bus tour called Jana Chaitanya Yatra "to expose the autocratic rule
        and misdeeds of Rama Rao". Rao had come to power after a van tour.[3]

        Mohana Ranga was born in Katuru near Vuyyuru, located in the Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh on 4 July 1947.
        His parents are Vangaveeti Seetharamaya, and Vangaveeti Savithramma. He had four elder brothers — Vangaveeti
        Koteswara Rao (passed away at early age), Vangaveeti Venkata Narayana Rao (APSRTC employee), Vangaveeti Sobhana
        Chalapathi Rao (ex-MLA Vuyyuru in 1989) and Vangaveeti Radha Krishna Rao Sr., popularly known as Robinhood
        Radha, who was murdered in 1974. Mohana Ranga was married to Chennupati Ratna Kumari; they had a son Radha
        Krishnan, named after Ranga's brother Vangaveeti Radha Krishna Sr., and a daughter, Vangaveeti Asha Kiran.

        Following his death, there were riots throughout the region.[3][4][5] The pattern of violence showed that the
        houses and property of Telugu Desam sympathisers who were mostly Kammas were attacked.[3] The city of Vijayawada
        was under curfew for 40 days. 42 people were killed. Devineni Rajasekhar (Nehru) was ordered by the Chief
        Minister to surrender himself, and the Director-General of Police resigned.[3] 44 people were accused of the
        crime; in 2002, the 33 who had not died in the meantime were all acquitted.[4] One of them, Chalasani
        Venkateswara Rao, known as Pandu, was murdered in 2010.[6
